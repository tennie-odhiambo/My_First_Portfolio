  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic and driven learner, passionate about front-end development and dedicated to building strong,
      user-centric web applications. Currently, I am mastering the core technologies of the web — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      —
      and working towards proficiency in popular frameworks like React and Vue.js. I enjoy tackling challenges, whether it’s
      creating a responsive design, optimizing user interfaces, or enhancing website performance. As a self-motivated
      learner,
      I continuously expand my knowledge through online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects. I am eager to apply my
      growing skill set to build real-world applications and contribute to projects that prioritize usability and design. My
      goal is to combine creativity with technical expertise to create seamless and engaging user experiences.</p>
